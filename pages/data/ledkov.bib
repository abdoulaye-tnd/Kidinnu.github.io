abstract={Space debris removal by a low thrust tethered spacecraft is considered in this paper. The objective of the work is the development of a simplified mathematical model describing the perturbed motion of the space tethered system under the influence of the aerodynamic drag forces and low thrust of the spacecraft’s engines and study the evolution of the space tethered system’s center of mass orbital parameters on large time intervals. The mathematical model describing the plane motion of a space tethered system with inextensible massless tether is constructed. Linearization and averaging of the mathematical model over the angle of the tether deflection are carried out. Separation of fast and slow variables is performed using Van der Pol approach. The obtained system is averaged over a fast variable. It is used to study the evolution of the center of mass orbit during space debris removal. The effect of the space tethered system attitude motion on the center of mass motion is analyzed. It is concluded that the greatest influence of the relative motion is observed in the case when the tether oscillates near the local vertical so that the space tug is located above the space debris. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={This paper is devoted to the problem of a small payload delivery from an orbit to the Earth by a reusable space tether system consisting of a satellite in circular orbit, a tether, and a bottom module. The payload is placed in a dynamically symmetrical bead capsule, which can slide along the tether. Three scenarios for the payload delivery are proposed: an uncontrolled sliding of the capsule, a soft docking with the bottom module following separation, and a soft docking and the tether spin-up. The objectives of the paper are developing a mathematical model of the system, conducting a numerical analysis of its behavior, and comparison of the descent scenarios. The mathematical model that takes into account the friction between the bead capsule and the inextensible three-segment tether is developed using the Lagrange formalism. The results show that high-frequency oscillations of the bead capsule, its sharp stop, and the tether tangling can be observed. The scenario comparison allows concluding that the third scenario is more effective in terms of the capsule's orbit perigee radius minimizing, butitrequires considerable time. The first scenario, compared with the second one, yields a significant decrease in perigee altitude, but it is more dangerous. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

abstract={The paper is devoted to the issue of active large space debris removal. The contactless method of influencing space debris through the ion flow is considered.

The aim of this paper is to study the effect of the atmosphere in LEO on the space debris behaviour during its removal. The equations of plane motion of space debris under the action of the ion beam, gravitational and aerodynamic forces and torques were obtained using Lagrange formalism.

abstract={The problem of a tether-assisted payload return from an elliptical orbit is considered in this study. In contrast to the existing works devoted to this issue, the article deals with a tether length control that provides a transfer of the payload into a descent trajectory from the tether rotation mode. Application of the swing principle for the tether control is investigated. The simplified mathematical model of the space tethered system is developed. It is shown that the stable limit cycle could exist under the considered control. The approximate analytical solution for this cycle is obtained. The stability of this solution is studied by the Lyapunov's theorems. The optimal control, which provides transfer of the payload into the descent trajectory with minimum perigee radius, is found as a result of the simulation series. It is shown that the tether should occur several turns before the payload separation. For example, in the YES-2 experiment, it is demonstrated that proposed control makes it possible to perform a payload return using a tether of considerably shorter length. The main conclusion of the paper is that the proposed scheme of the payload deorbit is more effective than the classical static or dynamic tether deployment schemes. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Among proposed applications of tethers in space, tether-assisted payload deorbiting projects are closest to the wide practical implementation. Three experiments were carried out successfully to date. The idea is to avoid the use of jet engines to generate a brake pulse, which transfers the payload on the descent orbit. The necessary reduction in velocity can be obtained through the use of features of the orbital motion of the space tether systems. Development of effective tether control methods are of great scientific and technological interest. The majority of research concerns the descent of a payload from a circular orbit. The aim of this research is development of an effective method of the tether control in tether-assisted payload deorbiting mission in the case of elliptical orbit of small eccentricity. The plane motion of the space tether system, which consists of a satellite, massless tether and payload, is considered. It is supposed that the center of mass of the system moves on a Keplerian orbit with small eccentricity. The tether length control law, which is based on a swing principle, is proposed. The equation of the controlled relative motion of the tether around the center of mass is obtained. The angle of the true anomaly is used as an independent variable. It is shown that in the vicinity of the local vertical a stable limit cycle with period 2 pi may exists for certain values of the coefficient in the control law. An approximate analytical equation of this cycle is obtained. It is shown that considered control law can transfer the system into rotation mode, which is more preferable for the tasks of payload deorbit, as it provides a greater reduction in the payload velocity. The optimal value of the control coefficient and the moment of payload separation, which ensure transfer of the payload into the orbit with a minimum altitude of the perigee, are founded numerically for the case of small eccentricity. The proposed control law can be used to develop new deorbiting systems. Copyright © 2017 by International Astronautical Federation (IAF). All rights reserved.},

abstract={The problem of a payload delivery from an elliptical orbit to Earth surface by a space tethered system is considered. This operation includes three stages: tethered motion, orbital flight of the payload to the border of the atmosphere, and its descent into the atmosphere. The third stage is critical for the whole mission, because the payload can be damaged as a result of thermal or dynamic loads. Thus, the first stage should provide the transition of the payload into a trajectory with the permissible loads. The objective of the paper is to determinate the conditions of the payload separation from the tether, which provide minimization of dynamical or thermal loads during the atmospheric motion or minimization of a perigee radius of the payload orbit. The mathematical models for the each stage and equations for loads calculation are presented in the paper. The series of numerical calculation shows that eccentricity of the satellite orbit significantly affects the trajectory of the capsule with the payload in the atmosphere. The location of separation points on elliptical orbits and angles of the tether deflection that provide a transfer of the capsule to the trajectory with minimum perigee radius, dynamical pressure, heat flux, and total heat were found. In contrast to the case of a circular orbit, the separation of the capsule at the local vertical does not provide a transfer into an orbit with a minimum radius of perigee. It was observed that the increase in eccentricity can leads to the decrease of the radius of perigee and the total heat, but at the same time to growth of the dynamic and thermal loads. The radius of perigee of the re-entry capsule cannot be considered as a single indicator of efficiency of the tether deployment control law. The set of thermal and mechanical constraints must be taken into consideration at the stages of the tether control law and the re-entry capsule design developing. © 2016 IAA},

abstract={Conical-shaped reentry capsules with a spherical bottom and a displaced center of mass from the axis of symmetry are widely used in astronautics for payload delivery. In the case of control-system breakage, modern reentry capsules allow a successful landing to be carried out in an uncontrolled mode. At the same time, the aerodynamic features of this particular shape create preconditions for chaotic motion. This can leadtoanoverturnofthe capsule, thus creating the risk of an accident. This article explores uncontrolled descent of the reentry capsule, with slight asymmetry, into the atmosphere. The system of differential equations describing uncontrollable descent of an asymmetric capsule in the atmosphere was recorded. Fast and slow variables were introduced. A simplified system of equations was obtained, describing the change of the spatial angle of attack. It was shown that chaotic motion can occur during the uncontrolled descent in the atmosphere. The algorithm of damping coefficient selection was developed on the basis of Melnikov's method. Its application allows for the elimination of chaosinthe whole descent trajectory, thus increasing the system reliability.

abstract={The problem of deorbiting large space debris (SLD) by means of a tethered space tug is considered. A mathematical model that describes the plane motion of the system is developed. The model takes into account the effects of the atmosphere and the rotary motion of the SLD around the SLD center of mass. The effects of the moment of tension force, gravitational moment, and pitch moment on the SLD behavior are studied. The evolution of the phase space of an angle of attack during the SLD descent is considered. Singular points are found for special cases of motion. It is shown that the effect of the atmosphere on the SLD dynamics can be neglected above an altitude of 300 km. The situation that a tether becomes slack is observed. In this case, the SLD can oscillate with increasing amplitude and even pass into rotation. This is a dangerous situation that can lead to tether rupture. A method of thrust control that provides tension in the tether during the SLD deorbiting is presented. A slack tether is also observed at atmospheric entry. This phenomenon is caused by the difference in drag forces that act on the SLD and on the space tug. The obtained results can be used in the preparation of missions of space debris deorbiting. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract={This paper presents a study of space elevator dynamics after the tether rupture due to its collision with a piece of space debris. The flexible heavy tether is modeled by a set of massive points connected by massless viscous bars. The tether is assumed to break at the geostationary orbit; its consequent motion is subject to gravitational and aerodynamic forces. Numerical simulation shows that, after entering the atmosphere, the majority of the tether segments are broken down by aerodynamic forces and smoothly descend to the Earth's surface. This process is accompaniedbythe formationoflarge loops, someofwhich can get beyond the atmosphere. Meanwhile, some parts of the tether reach the surface ofth e Earth with considerable speed, jeopardizing both spaceborne and ground objects in the equatorial plane.

Destruction of the space elevator in case when the ribbon is cut by a meteorite or by a piece of space debris, has to be studied as quite a probable scenario. Apart from the disastrous consequences for the primary structure, the parts of the destroyed elevator can jeopardize several spaceborne and ground objects. Here we aim at development of an adequate model for a space elevator and study its dynamics in case when the ribbon is cut. The elevator consists of a tether and a space station located beyond the geostationary orbit. A flexible tether with circular cross-section is simulated by a number of mass points connected by viscoelastic massless rods. We take into account the gravitation, aerodynamics, and inertial forces due to the Earth rotation. We assume that the tether does not slide over the ground. For numerical simulations we use the program TetherCalc based on the above approach. To increase the accuracy of the simulations, we use the algorithm of additional tether discretization for the segments subject to the Earth's atmosphere. Here we study the case when the ribbon is cut at a point close to the geostationary orbit. After the rupture, the upper segment of the tether moves away from the Earth, while the lower part starts falling to the ground. The inertial forces cause the deflection of the tether from the local vertical; afterwards it wraps around the Earth in the direction of its rotation. Analysis of the stress in the tether shows that is does not surpass the limit values for a carbon fibre. The tether made of the already available materials with the breaking point of 5 GPa can break at the final phase of the motion, when it is bent almost 180° around the Earth. After the rupture, the cut off part moves along a bounded orbit around the Earth. For a planet without an atmosphere, the tether would fall uniformly to the ground. However, if one considers the effect of the atmosphere, the motion changes completely. The aerodynamic forces reduce the normal component of the velocity, while the longitudinal component does not change. Therefore the part of the ribbon located beyond the atmosphere falls with increasing velocity and can outran the lower segment of the tether. Some segments become loose and glide freely in the air. One can observe formation of loops that sometimes get out of the atmosphere. The results of the simulation show that rupture of the space elevator ribbon can jeopardize the spacecraft in the equatorial plane since the ribbon moves with rather large velocity. After the ribbon enters the atmosphere, most of it slows down and falls smoothly, but some elements reach the Earth surface with rather large velocities. These parts of the tether can put in danger objects on the ground.},

abstract={Aimed at engineering students and professionals working in the field of mechanics of space flight, this book examines space tether systems - one of the most forward thinking directions of modern astronautics. The main advantage of this technology is the simplicity, profitability and ecological compatibility: space tethers allow the execution of various manoeuvers in orbit without costs of jet fuel due to the use of gravitational and electromagnetic fields of the Earth. This book will acquaint the reader with the modern state of the space tether's dynamics, with specific attention to the research projects of the nearest decades. The book presents the most effective mathematical models and the methods used for the analysis and prediction of space tether systems' motion; attention is also given on the influence of the tether on spacecraft's motion, to emergencies and chaotic modes. © 2012 Woodhead Publishing Limited.},

abstract={A mechanical system consisting of a spacecraft with weightless elastic tether and load is considered in the paper. The spacecraft motion under the action of tensile force of a radially oriented tether is investigated. It is shown that elastic tether oscillations can result in appearance of chaotic modes of spacecraft motion. By means of the Melnikov method a condition is obtained, allowing one to determine the measure of damping sufficient for prevention of these chaotic modes. The influence of system's mass-geometric and elastic characteristics on the form of phase portrait and on the value of periodic disturbance, caused by oscillations of the elastic vertical tether, is studied. © 2012 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper uncontrolled motions of blunt-shaped spacecrafts of small elongation descended in the rarefied atmosphere is considered. Such spacecrafts can have three balancing position of a spatial angle of attack. It can result in a resonance at change of a dynamic pressure at the descend. It is shown, that numerical integration of equations of perturbed motion does not allow to receive authentic results because of stochastic character of transients. Procedure of calculation of the upper and lower estimates of parameters of motion with use of received averaged equations and a stability criteria is developed. Efficiency of this procedure is shown on an example of hypothetical spacecraft descent. The analysis of ways of the resonance elimination is executed. In result, analytical formulas for the initial angular velocity of the spacecraft and for spacecraft's geometrical parameters are obtained. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Special attention is given to the case when the spacecraft possesses two stable balanced positions, and, hence, it can oscillate in dense atmospheric layers in the ranges of small or large angles of attack.
