abstract = {A scheme for despinning space debris using a modified yo-yo mechanism installed on the ADM module is proposed. The scheme can be used for space debris that rotates around the axis of symmetry with high angular velocity. The modified yo-yo mechanism does not contribute to the space debris problem. Each mass of the mechanism consists of two separable dome-shaped shells filled with liquid. Instead of releasing the masses after despin, the liquid is released from the shell, for example, by separation of the mass into parts.Wire guides for the reel are proposed, which follow the motion of the wires and prevent coming off the wires from the reel due to the attitude motion of the debris. A mathematical model of the spatial motion of the yo-yo mechanism is developed. The model is used to demonstrate the possibility of using the proposed scheme to despin space debris. The proposed scheme can be used to despin debris objects without using thruster engines. The rotation of the debris around the transverse axes also can be eliminated without using thrusters taking advantage of the tether connecting the tug with the ADM module.},

abstract = {Copyright {\"{i}}¿½ 2016 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). All rights reserved. One of the interesting applications of tethered satellite systems is the active debris removal problem. Although there have been several recent investigations, many aspects of this problem remain unexplored. One of them is the possibility of chaotic behaviour of the system, which includes a space tug, a tether, and space debris. Understanding the dynamical behaviour of such systems is essential for the success of any tether-assisted active debris removal mission. The chaotic motions of the system appear during the passive orbital motion of the system in an elliptical orbit or can be caused by the out-of-plane librations of the tether. On the active (post-burn) phase the chaotic motions of the system also possible in the presence of low-thrust applied to the space tug. We consider the chaotic motion of the system caused by the combined effects of the eccentricity of the orbit of the centre of mass, the thrust on the tug and the out-of-plane roll oscillations of the tether. Stable and unstable stationary solutions are presented for the in-plane motion of the system in a circular orbit, which depend on the value of the tug's thrust. The unstable solutions give rise to the chaotic motion of the system in the presence of additional disturbances. Poincare sections and Lyapunov exponents are used to investigate the motion of the system for different initial conditions and parameters. It is shown that the chaotic motions of the system depend on the value of the tug's thrust, so that using the tug with low thrust and starting the active phase of the active debris removal from unsuitable initial conditions (for the pitch and roll angles of the tether) can lead to chaotic motion of the system. The results obtained in the paper will be useful for selecting the system parameters of the space tug and the tether for a space debris removal system.},

abstract = {At present, thousands of space debris are located in Earth's orbits. It has a different size ranging from a few millimeters to tens of meters. Tethered systems are promising technology to de-orbit the space debris. The tethers have been proposed for reduction of space debris either through momentum transfer or use of electrodynamic effects. Another possible way to remove the large space debris from the critical areas of near-Earth orbit is using a tethered space tug attached to the space debris. Large space debris can strongly affect the motion of the space tug and the tether during the transportation process, which can lead to the loss of control of the tethered system. The problem of removal of a large space debris from the orbit to the Earth's surface is studied. The space transportation system is composed of two bodies connected by the tether. The first body is a space debris (upper rocket stage or a large nonfunctional satellite) and the second body is a space tug. The spatial motion of the system is studied in the gravity field of the Earth under the action of the space tug thruster, aerodynamic drag and the gravitational torque. Osculating elements of the orbit are used to describe the motion of the center of mass of the system. Particular attention is given to investigate the spatial motion of the space debris relative to the tether and to the space tug. The influence of the initial conditions and the properties of the system on the motion of the system are studied. {\textcopyright} 2013 IAA.},
